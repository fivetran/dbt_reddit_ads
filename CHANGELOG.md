# 📣 What does this dbt package do?
- Produces modeled tables that leverage Reddit Ads data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/reddit-ads) in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/reddit-ads#schemainformation) and builds off the output of our [Reddit Ads source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads_source).
- Enables you to better understand the performance of your ads across varying grains:
  - Providing an account, campaign, ad group, ad, and URL level reports.
