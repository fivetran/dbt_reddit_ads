# dbt_reddit_ads v0.2.1

[PR #]() includes the following updates:
## Bug Fixes
- This package now leverages the new `reddit_ads_extract_url_parameter()` for use in parsing out url parameters. This was added to create special logic for Databricks instances not supported by `dbt_utils.get_url_parameter()`.
  - This macro will be replaced with the `fivetran_utils.extract_url_parameter()` in the next breaking change.
## Under the Hood
- Included auto-releaser GitHub Actions workflow to automate future releases.

# dbt_reddit_ads v0.2.0
[PR #5](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads/pull/5) includes the following updates:
## Feature update ðŸŽ‰
- Unioning capability! This adds the ability to union source data from multiple reddit_ads connectors. Refer to the [Union Multiple Connectors README section](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads/blob/main/README.md#union-multiple-connectors) for more details.

## Under the hood ðŸš˜
- In the source package, updated tmp models to union source data using the `fivetran_utils.union_data` macro. 
- To distinguish which source each field comes from, added `source_relation` column in each staging and downstream model and applied the `fivetran_utils.source_relation` macro.
  - The `source_relation` column is included in all joins in the transform package. 
- Updated tests to account for the new `source_relation` column.
- Incorporated the new `fivetran_utils.drop_schemas_automation` macro into the end of each Buildkite integration test job.
- Updated the pull request [templates](/.github).
