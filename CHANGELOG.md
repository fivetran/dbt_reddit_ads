# dbt_reddit_ads v0.2.0
[PR #5](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads/pull/5) includes the following updates:
## Feature update ðŸŽ‰
- Unioning capability! This adds the ability to union source data from multiple reddit_ads connectors. Refer to the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads/blob/main/README.md) for more details.

## Under the hood ðŸš˜
- In the source package, updated tmp models to union source data using the `fivetran_utils.union_data` macro. 
- To distinguish which source each field comes from, added `source_relation` column in each staging and downstream model and applied the `fivetran_utils.source_relation` macro.
- Updated tests to account for the new `source_relation` column.
    - The `source_relation` column is included in all joins and window function partition clauses in the transform package.
