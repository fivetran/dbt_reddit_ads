| `stg_reddit_ads__campaign_country_report`            | New Model   |          |          | Uses `CAMPAIGN_COUNTRY_REPORT` source table |
| `stg_reddit_ads__campaign_country_conversions_report`                      | New Model   |          |          | Uses `CAMPAIGN_COUNTRY_CONVERSIONS_REPORT` source table       |
| `stg_reddit_ads__campaign_country_report_tmp`        | New Model   |          |          | Uses `CAMPAIGN_COUNTRY_REPORT` source table |
| `stg_reddit_ads__campaign_country_conversions_report_tmp`                  | New Model   |          |          | Uses `CAMPAIGN_COUNTRY_CONVERSIONS_REPORT` source table       |

## Features
- Added the following vars to enable/disabled the new `CAMPAIGN_COUNTRY_REPORT` or `CAMPAIGN_COUNTRY_CONVERSIONS_REPORT` sources. See the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads/blob/main/README.md#Step-4-Enable-disable-models-and-sources) for more details.
  - `reddit_ads_campaign_country_report_enabled` - defaults is `true`
  - `reddit_ads_campaign_country_conversions_report_enabled` - default is `true`, requires `CAMPAIGN_COUNTRY_REPORT`

## Under the Hood
- Added seed data for testing new sources

## Documentation
- Updated dbt documentation to reflect new tables and column additions.
- Added Quickstart model counts to README. ([#17](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads/pull/17))
- Corrected references to connectors and connections in the README. ([#17](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads/pull/17))

# dbt_reddit_ads v0.3.1
[PR #15](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads/pull/15) includes the following updates:

## Bug Fix
- Ensures the addition of conversion metrics in [v0.3.0](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#dbt_reddit_ads-v030) is truly backwards compatible and will avoid duplicate column errors regardless of any pre-existing configurations.
  - Specifically, if you were previously utilizing [passthrough column](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads?tab=readme-ov-file#passing-through-additional-metrics) variables to include fields called `conversions`, `view_through_conversions`, `total_value`, or `total_items`, the package's version of these fields will take precedence. Your fields will be included as well, but suffixed with a `_c`.

## Under the Hood
- Creates the `reddit_ads_persist_pass_through_columns` macro to support the above behavior. 
- Updates consistency validation tests (maintainers only) to include conversion metric comparisons.

## Documentation
- Documented `_c` bug fix solution in the [DECISIONLOG](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads/blob/main/DECISIONLOG.md). 

# dbt_reddit_ads v0.3.0
[PR #13](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads/pull/13) includes the following **BREAKING CHANGE** updates:

## Features: Conversion Metrics
- Introduces the following conversion fields to the Reddit Ads `reddit_ads__<entity>_report` models:
  - `conversions` (aliased from `click_through_conversion_attribution_window_month`): Total attributed click-through conversions for the given month-long window.
  - `view_through_conversions` (aliased from `view_through_conversion_attribution_window_month`): Total attributed view-through conversions for the given month-long window.
  - `total_value`: Total monetary value associated with a conversion event.
  - `total_items`: Total number of items involved in a conversion event.
- Introduces the `<entity>_conversions_passthrough_metrics` variables to allow additional fields from the source `_conversion_report` tables. We use the maximum attribution window when considering conversions and therefore retrieve conversions metrics from the `click_through_conversion_attribution_window_month` (conversions) and `view_through_conversion_attribution_window_month` (view_through_conversions) fields from the respective source tables. For information on how to configure these variables to bring in additional windows and fields, refer to the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#passing-through-additional-metrics).
- Introduces the `reddit_ads__conversion_event_types` variable to note which kinds of events should be considered conversions (and therefore be surfaced in conversion metrics). By default, this package considers `purchase`, `lead`, and `custom` events to be conversions. See [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#configure-conversion-event-types) for details on how to adjust this.

## Upstream Source Package Updates
To support the addition of conversion metrics here, [v0.3.0](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads_source/releases/tag/v0.2.0) of `reddit_ads_source` included the following update:
- Introduces 4 new staging models to bring in conversion metrics (click-through conversions, view-through conversions, total value, and total items) across different dimensions:
  - `stg_reddit_ads__account_conversions_report`
  - `stg_reddit_ads__ad_group_conversions_report`
  - `stg_reddit_ads__ad_conversions_report`
  - `stg_reddit_ads__campaign_conversions_report`
> Note: If you would like to include conversion metrics, please ensure you have the `account_conversions_report`, `ad_group_conversions_report`, `ad_conversions_report`, and `campaign_conversions_report` source tables syncing in your Reddit Ads connector(s). Otherwise, the package will run successfully but produce `null` conversion metric values.

## Under the Hood
- Coalesces each pre-existing metrics (ie `clicks`, `impressions`, and `spend`) with `0` to avoid the complications of `null` in aggregations.
- Adds the respective seed data for the new models in addition to updating relevant documentation.
- Adds documentation explaining potential discrepancies across reporting grains.
- Adds new Buildkite run step to test different configurations of the `reddit_ads__conversion_event_types` variable.

# dbt_reddit_ads v0.2.1

[PR #8](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads/pull/8) includes the following updates:
## Bug Fixes
- This package now leverages the new `reddit_ads_extract_url_parameter()` macro for use in parsing out url parameters. This was added to create special logic for Databricks instances not supported by `dbt_utils.get_url_parameter()`.
  - This macro will be replaced with the `fivetran_utils.extract_url_parameter()` macro in the next breaking change of this package.
## Under the Hood
- Included auto-releaser GitHub Actions workflow to automate future releases.

# dbt_reddit_ads v0.2.0
[PR #5](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads/pull/5) includes the following updates:
## Feature update ðŸŽ‰
- Unioning capability! This adds the ability to union source data from multiple reddit_ads connectors. Refer to the [Union Multiple Connectors README section](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads/blob/main/README.md#union-multiple-connectors) for more details.

## Under the hood ðŸš˜
- In the source package, updated tmp models to union source data using the `fivetran_utils.union_data` macro. 
- To distinguish which source each field comes from, added `source_relation` column in each staging and downstream model and applied the `fivetran_utils.source_relation` macro.
  - The `source_relation` column is included in all joins in the transform package. 
- Updated tests to account for the new `source_relation` column.
- Incorporated the new `fivetran_utils.drop_schemas_automation` macro into the end of each Buildkite integration test job.
- Updated the pull request [templates](/.github).

# dbt_reddit_ads v0.1.0

## Initial Release
- This is the initial release of this package. 

# ðŸ“£ What does this dbt package do?
- Produces modeled tables that leverage Reddit Ads data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/reddit-ads) in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/reddit-ads#schemainformation) and builds off the output of our [Reddit Ads source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads_source).
- Enables you to better understand the performance of your ads across varying grains:
  - Providing an account, campaign, ad group, ad, and URL level reports.
- Materializes output models designed to work simultaneously with our [multi-platform Ad Reporting package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting).
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your source and modeled Reddit Ads data through the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_reddit_ads/).
